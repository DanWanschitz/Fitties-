  <h1>FitBrainLab: Building Mental Resilience </h1>
  <p>
    FitBrainLab is about building resilience, not just in your body, but in your mind.
    Just like physical exercise strengthens your muscles, these games strengthen cognitive skills like memory, focus, and mental flexibility.
  </p>
  <p>
    These abilities aren’t just mental, they play a crucial role in how we form habits, stay motivated, and stick to physical routines, especially when challenges arise.
