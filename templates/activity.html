    <div class="habit-intro-text">
      <p>
        Building a routine creates structure in your day and helps reduce mental clutter. When you anchor physical activity to regular parts of your schedule — like a set time after meals or before studying — it becomes easier to follow through without having to think about it. Over time, routines create a sense of stability and control, which can support better sleep, sharper focus, and improved emotional well-being. The goal isn’t perfection — it’s simply showing up for yourself in small, repeatable ways that build momentum.

        <p>Start with just 5–10 minutes a day, even something simple like a few stretches right after waking up. Staying consistent is much easier when it feels manageable.</p>
